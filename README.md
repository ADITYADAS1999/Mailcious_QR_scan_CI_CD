# 🔐 Automated Docker image Security Scanner  


In the modern era, most organizations have shifted from **monolithic architectures** to **microservices-based applications** deployed in **containerized environments** such as Docker and Kubernetes. While this transition improves scalability, agility, and deployment speed, it also introduces **new security challenges**. With CI/CD pipelines powering rapid software delivery, ensuring security at every stage—known as **DevSecOps**—has become a critical requirement.  

One of the major concerns in this landscape is the **detection and remediation of vulnerabilities** in Docker images, application code, and dependencies. Without continuous scanning and compliance mapping, organizations risk exposing their systems to attackers.  

To address this, we developed a **GitHub Actions workflow** that automatically:  
- Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities using **Trivy, Bandit, and Docker Scout**.  
- Generates **JSON and PDF reports** for detailed analysis.  
- Maps detected vulnerabilities to **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, **MITRE ATT&CK techniques**, and **OWASP Top 10 risks**.  

This project demonstrates **automated DevSecOps practices** and provides a framework for **threat assessment, vulnerability management, and compliance reporting** directly within the CI/CD pipeline.  


## 📌 Introduction  
Containers have become the backbone of modern application deployment, but they also introduce unique security challenges.  
This project, **Automated Docker Security Scanner**, was designed to address those challenges by **automating vulnerability scanning of Docker images and applications**.  

It combines multiple open-source tools and recognized cybersecurity frameworks into a single workflow.  
The output is a **professional, consolidated PDF report** that organizations can use to detect, analyze, and mitigate security risks.  

Key Features:  
- Scans Docker images and code for vulnerabilities.  
- Maps findings to **NIST CSF**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **OWASP Top 10**.  
- Automatically runs in **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipelines.  
- Generates a **detailed PDF report** with charts and compliance mappings.

## ⚙️ Workflow & Tools Used  

This project includes a **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/docker-scan.yml`) that automates the **DevSecOps security pipeline**.  
The workflow runs automatically on every push to the `main` branch and executes the following stages:  

---

### 🔹 1. Build Docker Image  
```yaml
- name: Build Docker Image
  run: docker build -t my-custom-app:latest ./docker
```
- Tool: Docker
- Purpose: Builds the application container image from the Dockerfile inside the ./docker directory.
- Output: A containerized application (my-custom-app:latest) that is ready for security scanning.


### 🔹 2. Trivy (Docker Image Vulnerability Scanner)

```
- name: Run Trivy Docker Scan
  run: trivy image --ignore-unfixed --exit-code 0 --format json --output reports/trivy.json my-custom-app:latest
```
- Tool: Trivy
- Purpose: Scans the built Docker image for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OS packages and dependencies.
- Output: reports/trivy.json → JSON report containing vulnerability details with severity levels.

### 🔹 3. Bandit (Python Source Code Analysis)

```
- name: Run Bandit Scan
  run: bandit -ll -ii -r . -f json -o reports/bandit.json || true
```
- Tool: Bandit
- Purpose: Performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for Python source code.
- Detects issues such as:
-Insecure function usage (eval, exec)
-Hardcoded credentials
-Insecure file permissions
- Output: reports/bandit.json → JSON report of security issues in code.


### 🔹 4. Docker Scout (Optional Dependency Scanner)

```
# docker scout quickview
# docker scout cves
```
- Tool: Docker Scout
- Purpose: Provides insights into container dependencies, image provenance, and supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Benefit: Complements Trivy by analyzing image layers and dependencies more deeply.

### 🔹 5. MITRE ATT&CK (Atomic Red Team Simulation)

```
- name: Run Atomic Red Team (MITRE ATT&CK)
  shell: pwsh
  run: |
    git clone https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team.git
    git clone https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam.git
    Import-Module ./invoke-atomicredteam/Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1 -Force
    Invoke-AtomicTest T1003 ...
```
- Tools:
-Atomic Red Team
-Invoke-AtomicRedTeam

- Purpose: Simulates MITRE ATT&CK techniques against the container or application.
- Example: T1003 – Credential Dumping test.
- Output: reports/mitre_T1003.json → JSON report mapping vulnerabilities to real-world adversarial behaviors.

### 🔹 6. NIST CSF Mapping

```
- name: Map Results to NIST CSF
  run: python scripts/mappings.py reports/ nist_report.json
```

- Purpose: Maps scan results from Trivy, Bandit, and MITRE ATT&CK into NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) categories:
- Identify → Asset discovery issues
- Protect → Missing patches, insecure configs
- Detect → Intrusion detection gaps
- Respond/Recover → Response & recovery mechanisms

### 🔹 7. Report Generation (Charts + PDF)

```
- name: Generate Charts
  run: python scripts/gen_charts.py

- name: Generate PDF Report
  run: python scripts/generate_report.py
```
- Purpose: Produces a professional PDF report consolidating:
- Vulnerability details
- Severity breakdown (with charts)
- NIST CSF mapping
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- OWASP Top 10 mapping


### 🔹 8. Upload Artifacts

```
- name: Upload PDF Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: docker-vulnerability-report
    path: report.pdf
```

- Purpose: Uploads both the PDF report and raw JSON reports as GitHub build artifacts.
- Benefit: Results can be downloaded and reviewed by security teams after each workflow run.






## ⚡ Security Framework Integration  

### 🔹 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)  
The **NIST CSF** provides five functions: **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**.  
Each vulnerability is automatically mapped to one of these functions.  
For example:  
- A missing patch may map to **Protect**.  
- An insecure API exposure may map to **Detect/Respond**.  

This ensures findings are not just technical but **aligned with compliance requirements**.  

### 🔹 MITRE ATT&CK  
The **MITRE ATT&CK** knowledge base describes how attackers exploit systems.  
Vulnerabilities detected are mapped to adversarial techniques.  
For example:  
- Credential leakage → **T1003 (Credential Dumping)**.  
- Insecure file permissions → **T1078 (Valid Accounts)**.  

This allows security teams to understand **how real attackers might exploit vulnerabilities**.  

### 🔹 OWASP Top 10  
The **OWASP Top 10** is an industry-standard list of the most critical web application risks.  
This scanner maps findings to OWASP categories, such as:  
- **A01: Broken Access Control**  
- **A03: Injection Attacks**  
- **A04: Insecure Design**  

This helps prioritize remediation according to **global best practices**.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
The primary purpose of this project is to:  
- **Automate vulnerability management** for Dockerized applications.  
- Provide a **single, consolidated PDF report** instead of multiple scattered outputs.  
- Help developers, DevOps, and security teams **integrate security into CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps)**.  
- Align findings with **compliance frameworks and attacker models**.  

---

## ✅ Advantages  

- **Automated** → Scans run automatically with every code push (via GitHub Actions).  
- **Comprehensive** → Covers Docker images, source code, and dependencies.  
- **Framework-Aware** → Maps to NIST CSF, MITRE ATT&CK, and OWASP Top 10.  
- **Professional Reports** → PDF reports with charts, severity analysis, and framework mappings.  
- **Open-Source & Extensible** → Easily add new scanners or frameworks.  

---

## ⚡ Challenges Faced  

1. **Data Normalization** → Different scanners produce JSON in different formats.  
2. **Framework Mapping** → Consistently mapping vulnerabilities across NIST, MITRE, and OWASP required custom logic (`mappings.py`).  
3. **PDF Reporting** → Ensuring the final report is clear, visual, and boardroom-ready.  
4. **Automation in CI/CD** → Ensuring scans work smoothly within GitHub Actions with minimal setup.
